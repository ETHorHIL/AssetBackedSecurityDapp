-This is the code for a prototype process replication of a securitization.  
-The project is still under construction, the goal was to develop the contracts, not an working Dapp.  
-Run 'truffle migrate' and 'truffle test' to see a simulation of the transaction flow.  
-See the .pdf file for further information on securitization and the contract framework.
